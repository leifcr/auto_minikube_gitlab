# values-minikube.yaml
# This example intended as baseline to use Minikube for the deployment of GitLab
# - Minimized CPU/Memory load, can fit into 2 CPU, 4 GB of RAM (barely)
# - Services that are not compatible with how Minikube runs are disabled
# - Some services entirely removed, or scaled down to 1 replica.
# - Configured to use __IP__, and nip.io for the domain

# Minimal settings

  ingress:
    configureCertmanager: false

# Use the `ingress` addon, not our Ingress (can't map 22/80/443)
